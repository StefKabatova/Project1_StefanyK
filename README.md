## Explanation of technologies and approach take
In order used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to develop my game. I used event listeners for my buttons and
functions to add content to the page. For styling I used a flexbox to arrange my game container.

The way that I decided to approach my game is to arrange each category as a object with its specific keys and properties. Then use id and jQuery methods to add content to the page.


## Unsolved Issues
The only way to reset the game is by reloading the page.
No correct answers are shown for the questions.
Overall, I need to rearrange my objects structure so I can refactor my code.
